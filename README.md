# Mechagogue

A JAX-based machine learning framework for reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and evolutionary algorithms.

## Features

- **Reinforcement Learning**: DQN, Vanilla Policy Gradient
- **Supervised Learning**: Backpropagation and Genetic Algorithms
- **Evolutionary Methods**: Natural selection with population dynamics
- **Neural Networks**: MLPs, CNNs, attention layers, Q-networks
- **Optimizers**: SGD, Adam, AdamW, RMSProp
- **Environment Builders**: MDPs, POMDPs, multi-agent games
- **Utilities**: PyTree operations, serialization, environment wrappers

## Setup

Create a conda environment. Inside it, run:
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start
