'''
The natural selection algorithm simulates a population of players forward
over multiple time steps.  Each step uses a model function to compute an
action for each agent, then uses those actions to compute environment
dynamics.  In addition to a state and observation, the environment should
produce a list of players that currently exist, and their parents.  This
information is then used to construct the weights of new players.

This algorithm does not have an optimization objective, but instead relies
on the environment dynamics to update the population over time.
